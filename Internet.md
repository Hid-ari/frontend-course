## Introduction to the Internet

The Internet is a global network of computers connected to each other which communicate through a standardized set of protocols.

### When we going to talk about a new subject it's good to know its history.

- 1960s: Beginnings and ARPANET - The concept of a global communication network that could continue to operate even in the aftermath of a nuclear war began in the 1960s. In 1969, the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, connected four universities: UCLA, Stanford, UC Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah, marking the birth of what would eventually become the Internet.

- 1970s: Development of Protocols - During the 1970s, key protocols such as TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) were developed by Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn. These protocols allowed multiple networks to interconnect, forming a "network of networks."

- 1980s: Expansion and Adoption - In 1983, ARPANET adopted TCP/IP, and shortly afterward began to expand beyond military and academic institutions. During this decade, the Domain Name System (DNS) was also established, facilitating Internet navigation.

- 1990s: Birth of the World Wide Web - Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989 while working at CERN. The web utilized hypertext for accessing information and navigation, revolutionizing how the Internet was used. In 1993, the Mosaic browser was released, popularizing the Internet among the general public.

- 21st Century: Expansion and Globalization - The advent of new technologies such as fiber optics and advances in telecommunications have enabled massive expansion of the Internet. The adoption of mobile devices and the development of social media have further transformed how we interact online.

- Current Era: Internet of Things and Beyond - Today, the Internet connects not just computers and smartphones, but a wide array of devices through the Internet of Things (IoT). This has opened up new dimensions of interconnectivity and raised new challenges in terms of security and privacy.
